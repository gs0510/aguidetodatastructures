# Introduction
1. Data is the basic fact or identity that is utilized in calculation and manipulation.
2. Data may be single value or it may be set of values. Whether itâ€™s a single value or a group of value, to be processed it must be organized in a particular fashion.
3. Organization leads to structuring of data and hence our mission to study data structures.
* Data
	* Numeric data 
		* Integers
		* Floating point
	* Alphanumeric data 

# Data structure-Definition
In any area of application the input data and output data may each have a unique structure.
1. Data structure is representation of logical relationship existing between individual elements of data.
2. Data structure is way of organizing all data items that considers not only their storage but also their relationship to each other.
3. Data structure can also be define as a mathematical or logical model of particular organization of data item.

Data structure mainly specifies four things:-
- Organization
- Accessing
- Degree of associativity
- Processing alternatives for information

* Data structure Hierarchy
	* Primitive 
		* Integer
		* Float
		* Character
		* Pointer
	* Non primitive 
		* Arrays
		* Lists
			* Linear Lists
				* Stacks
				* Queues
			* Non Linear Lists
				* Graphs
				* Trees
		* Files
# Memory Allocations in C
Two types of memory allocations in C are:
1. Compile time or Static Allocation
2. Runtime or Dynamic Allocation (using Pointers)

### Compile time or Static Allocation
Required amount of memory is allocated to program element at the start of program.
Eg:	int x,y;(2 bytes each)
	float a[5];(20 bytes)
Problems in static memory allocation
There is no bound checking for array boundaries, i.e. If you have declared an array of five elements and by mistake you are intending to add more than  five values in the array it will still work without error.
